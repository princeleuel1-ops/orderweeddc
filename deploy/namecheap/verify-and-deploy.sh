# Owner-safe deployment verifier — ONE command, every gate, auto-rollback.
#
#   sh verify-and-deploy.sh <artifact-url> <artifact-filename> <expected-sha256>
#
# What it guarantees:
#   - downloads with curl --fail-with-body and verifies SHA-256 before anything
#   - rejects non-webpack artifacts, failed/pending isolation receipts, and
#     unresolved-external scan failures (reads receipt.json)
#   - captures the production DB hash BEFORE the swap and proves it unchanged
#     AFTER the swap (code-only deploys never touch data)
#   - NEVER runs bootstrap or seed automatically
#   - restarts via the release-local restart script (correct path)
#   - waits with bounded retries; separates ORIGIN health (via --resolve when
#     needed) from PUBLIC-DNS health; prints ORIGIN_HEALTHY_PUBLIC_DNS_PENDING
#     when the origin is fine but public resolution lags
#   - automatically rolls the code back if origin health fails
#   - returns nonzero on any failed gate
